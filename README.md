# Working WIth Data Structure in C++

## Topics

### Arrays:-
1. Insertion
2. Traversal
3. Deletion
4. Merging
5. Merging Two Sorted Array
6. Copying One Array into Another
7. Counting Each Element Frequency
8. Matrix Multiply


### Linked List:-

FILE NAME :- <br>
a.createLinkedList1 => Singly Linked List <br>
b.createLinkedList2 => Doubly Linked List <br>
b.createLinkedList3 => Circular Linked List <br>

1. Singly Linked List <br>
    => Created List <br>
    => Print List <br>
    => insert at Beginning <br>
    => insert at End <br>
    => Count Number of Element <br>
    => insert at Specific Position <br>
    => delete Element at Beginning <br>
    => delete Element ar End <br>
    => delete at Specific Position <br>
    => search Element <br>
    => Reverse List using Iteration <br>

2. Doubly Linked List <br>
    => Created List <br>
    => insert at Beginning <br>
    => insert at End <br>
    => insert Element at Specific Position <br>
    => Count Number of Element <br>
    => delete Element at Beginning <br>
    => delete Element from End <br>
