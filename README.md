1. Singly Linked List <br>
    => Created List <br>
    => Print List <br>
    => insert at Beginning <br>
    => insert at End <br>
    => Count Number of Element <br>
    => insert at Specific Position <br>
    => delete Element at Beginning <br>
    => delete Element at End <br>
    => delete at Specific Position <br>
    => search Element <br>
    => Reverse List using Iteration <br>

2. Doubly Linked List <br>

    => Count Number of Element <br>
    => delete Element at Beginning <br>
    => delete Element from End <br>
    => reverse List using Iteration <br>

3. Circular Linked List <br>
    => Created List <br>
    => Print List <br>
    => insert at Beginning <br>
    => insert at End <br>
